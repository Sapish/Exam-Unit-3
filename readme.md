Imported some of my old code to call the api, and got the challenge.

First challenge received, crack the code: “☉☿☽♂☉”.
After copy pasting the symbols into google i found that they are "planetary symbols" used in astrology and astronomy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_symbols
Since the task is about alchemy, that probably is an indication that i will need to link the symbols to the metals. So my answer would be a list of the metals that match the symbols.
