Imported some of my old code to call the api, and got the challenge.

First challenge received, crack the code: “☉☿☽♂☉”.
After copy pasting the symbols into google i found that they are "planetary symbols" used in astrology and astronomy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_symbols
Since the task is about alchemy, that probably is an indication that i will need to link the symbols to the metals. So my answer would be a list of the metals that match the symbols.
Running into the problem that was shown in class where im getting the HTML bug. (fixed by reading the task again, seeing that i need to submit answer using a POST request, rewrote my code to fit this need.)
I believe im writing the answer correct, but im still getting wrong answer? "Gold, Quicksilver, Silver, Iron, Gold".
Fixed the answer, i was not returning an array.
I have now solved the task manually and got the correct answer, i will now try implementing code to solve the challenge.
  1. Added code to decode the symbols over to metals.
  2.
